# Why can't I open links or folders on Linux?

There are currently issues with the AppImage edition of the Modrinth App. When using the AppImage version, you will be unable to click any buttons having to do with the web browser, file manager, or copying information to your clipboard. As a workaround, try using the .deb version, if possible.

This issue is being tracked as [#520](https://github.com/modrinth/theseus/issues/520).
