# How do I share a modpack with others?

Once you have [created an `.mrpack` file](modpack-basics.md), you can share this file with the world.

The main method of distribution is via the [Modrinth website](https://modrinth.com). First, log in to the website. Then, you can create a project by hovering over your avatar and clicking "Create a project". Make sure to select "Modpack" as the project type. Follow the checklist, ensuring you are following the rules and have [obtained permission to include each file](../../modpacks/permissions.md). Once submitted for review, you can expect it to be reviewed by our moderators [within 24-48 hours](../index.md#review-times).

Alternatively, if your pack is only for you and a few friends, you can share the `.mrpack` file using your file host of choice â€” [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com), [OneDrive](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onedrive/online-cloud-storage), [Dropbox](https://dropbox.com), etc. This method of distribution is much faster and does not involve intervention by Modrinth's moderators. However, it does not allow users to easily move between multiple versions of the same modpack.

Here are a bit of pros and cons about each option:

| Method of distribution          | Pros                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Cons                                                                                                                                                                            |

| **Sharing on Modrinth.com**     | Users can easily update and downgrade the version of the pack they're using at the click of only a few buttons                                                                                                                      | You must get the pack reviewed and approved by Modrinth's moderators to be compliant with [Modrinth's rules](https://modrinth.com/legal/rules) before it is publicly accessible |
| **Sharing using a direct file** | The pack can instantly be shared with others without needing to wait for a moderator review, and you do not need to go through the effort of creating a project compliant with [Modrinth's rules](https://modrinth.com/legal/rules) | Users must manually update the modpack each time, as there is no way to automatically update without a Modrinth project being present                                           |
