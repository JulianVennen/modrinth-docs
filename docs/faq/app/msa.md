# Why can't I sign in to my Microsoft account?

Due to the way that Microsoft's authentication systems work, it can sometimes be difficult to log in to your Microsoft/Minecraft account to play the game. However, there are some steps you can do to troubleshoot to potentially help the process.

## 1. Make sure you have a Minecraft username set

In order to play Minecraft, you need to have a Minecraft username set. In order to do this, log in to [Minecraft.net](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us). Then, go to the [Profile Name](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/msaprofile/mygames/editprofile) section. When prompted to set a username, do so here. Then, log into the Modrinth App.

## 2. Double-check you're using the right account

Double-check to make sure you are using the same Microsoft account with the same email as the one you used to log in to Minecraft.net. If Microsoft is trying to log you into a different email, click the "Sign in with a different Microsoft account" button near the bottom.

## 3. Disable system-level VPNs and ad blockers

If you're sure you're logging in with the correct Microsoft account, there may be something with your configuration preventing the Modrinth App from communicating with Microsoft's servers. Try disabling any system-level or network-level ad blockers, or try setting up a VPN to a country with access to Microsoft services.

## 4. Keep trying until it works

Unfortunately, if you are sure you're following all previous steps, you may simply need to keep retrying until it works. Again, Microsoft's authentication system can be difficult at times, so no alternative solutions are currently known.
