# How long will my submitted project be "under review" for?

Modrinth's team of content moderators work hard to review all submitted projects. Typically, you can expect a new project to be reviewed within 24 to 48 hours. Please keep in mind that larger projects, especially modpacks, may require more time to review. Certain holidays or events may also lead to additional delays depending on moderator availability.

<!--
:::info Update from December 2023
**Happy Holidays from Modrinth!** Over the coming days, moderation and project reviews may be delayed as we celebrate the holiday season with our families.

Reviews may continue to be delayed into early January as we "catch up" on what we lost.

:::info Update from December 16th, 2023
Due to a high number of incoming projects, reviews are presently delayed. Please do not request updates on how long it will take to review a given project, as this will slow us down.
:::

Due to the way that Modrinth's queue system works, it is not possible for something to be "lost in the queue". If your project displays as "Under review", it will be reviewed. Please note that asking about the status of your project in the queue **will not** expedite its review.
