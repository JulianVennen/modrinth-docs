# How long will my submitted project be "under review" for?

Modrinth's team of content moderators work hard to review all submitted projects. Typically, you can expect a new project to be reviewed within 24 to 48 hours. Please keep in mind that larger projects, especially modpacks, may require more time to review. Certain holidays or events may also lead to delays depending on moderator availability.

:::info Update from November 2023
**Happy Thanksgiving from Modrinth!** Over the coming days, moderation and project reviews may be delayed as we celebrate and recover from our food comas.

Reviews may continue to be delayed for approximately a week afterwards as we "catch up" on what we lost.
:::

Thanks to the way that Modrinth's queue system works, it is not possible for something to be "lost in the queue". If your project displays as "Under review", it will be reviewed.
