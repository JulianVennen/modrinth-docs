# Why can't I access my notifications?

Sometimes, errors such as "TypeError: M is null" and "Cannot stringify arbitrary non-POJOs" will appear when trying to access your Modrinth dashboard.

You are encountering this issue because you have too many notifications associated with your Modrinth account (i.e. more than 1,800). This includes both read and unread. Either in an email to support@modrinth.com or a support thread in [our Discord server](https://discord.modrinth.com), please provide your username alongside permission that we can clear your notifications.

Typically, we will only clear your read notifications, but if you do not have any read notifications, we will clear all of them.
