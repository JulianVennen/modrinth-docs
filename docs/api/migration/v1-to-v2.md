# From API v1 to API v2

These bullet points cover most changes in the v2 API, but please note that fields containing `mod` in most contexts have been shifted to `project`.  For example, in the search route, the field `mod_id` was renamed to `project_id`.

- The search route has been moved from `/api/v1/mod` to `/v2/search`
- New project fields: `project_type` (may be `mod` or `modpack`), `moderation_message` (which has a `message` and `body`), `gallery`
- New search facet: `project_type`
- Alphabetical sort removed (it didn't work and is not possible due to limits in MeiliSearch)
- New search fields: `project_type`, `gallery`
  - The gallery field is an array of URLs to images that are part of the project's gallery
- The gallery is a new feature which allows the user to upload images showcasing their mod to the CDN which will be displayed on their mod page
- Internal change: Any project file uploaded to Modrinth is now validated to make sure it's a valid Minecraft mod, Modpack, etc.
  - For example, a Forge 1.17 mod with a JAR not containing a mods.toml will not be allowed to be uploaded to Modrinth
- In project creation, projects may not upload a mod with no versions to review, however they can be saved as a draft
  - Similarly, for version creation, a version may not be uploaded without any files
- Donation URLs have been enabled
- New project status: `archived`. Projects with this status do not appear in search
- Tags (such as categories, loaders) now have icons (SVGs) and specific project types attached
- Dependencies have been wiped and replaced with a new system
- Notifications now have a `type` field, such as `project_update`

Along with this, project subroutes (such as `/v2/project/{id}/version`) now allow the slug to be used as the ID. This is also the case with user routes.

## Minotaur v1 to v2

Minotaur 2.x introduced a few breaking changes to how your buildscript is formatted.

First, instead of registering your own `publishModrinth` task, Minotaur now automatically creates a `modrinth` task. As such, you can replace the `task publishModrinth(type: TaskModrinthUpload) {` line with just `modrinth {`.

To declare supported Minecraft versions and mod loaders, the `gameVersions` and `loaders` arrays must now be used. The syntax for these are pretty self-explanatory.

Instead of using `releaseType`, you must now use `versionType`. This was actually changed in v1.2.0, but very few buildscripts have moved on from v1.1.0.

Dependencies have been changed to a special DSL. Create a `dependencies` block within the `modrinth` block, and then use `scope.type("project/version")`. For example, `required.project("fabric-api")` adds a required project dependency on Fabric API.

You may now use the slug anywhere that a project ID was previously required.
